<h1>SeaFest Machine-Learning Path<h1>
<h2>Machine Learning:</h2>
We incorporated two types of datasets, namely Fish Freshness and Classification datasets, sourced from multiple platforms including Kaggle and Roboflow. Additionally, we supplemented our collection by gathering additional data firsthand to ensure a comprehensive and diverse dataset for training and validating our machine learning models. We used 9 classes for Fish’s Classification (from 47 classes) with a total of 2.582 images and 2 classes for Fish’s Freshness with a total of 4.880 images. 

<h2>Types of Fish Recognized by Classification Models:</h2>

1. Bandeng
2. Belanak (Mullet)
3. Gabus
4. Gurame
5. Kakap Merah
6. Lele
7. Longtail Tuna
8. Patin
9. Tenggiri (Spanish Mackerel)
 
<h2>Requirements:</h2>
 
1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [Jupyter Notebook](https://test-jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
2. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.8 or above
3. Tensorflow 3.10 or above
4. CUDA Deep Neural Network (cuDNN) (To Utilize GPU Compute Units) - Optional
